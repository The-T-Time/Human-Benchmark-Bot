# HumanBenchmark-Bot

**HumanBenchmark-Bot** is an automated tool that performs all tests on [HumanBenchmark.com](https://humanbenchmark.com) using web element interactions. It supports multiple browsers and provides high or infinite scores across all available benchmarks.

## Features

- Fully automates all Human Benchmark tests  
- Cross-browser support (Firefox, Chrome, Edge)  
- Achieves near-perfect or infinite scores  
- Custom level selection for applicable tests  
- Lightweight: no pre-installed browsers required  
- Non-intrusive: can run in the background

## How It Works

1. **Browser Prompt**  
   The bot will prompt the user to choose a browser:  
   - `Chrome`  
   - `Firefox`  
   - `Edge`  
   
   > Note: You do not need to have the selected browser installed.

2. **Mode Selection**  
   Next, the bot will ask for the desired test mode.

3. **Level Input**  
   For tests with level progression, the bot will request a level input.  
   - **Chimp Test:** Maxes out at level 37  
   - **Other level-based tests:** No cap

## Usage Guidelines

- Once the automation window is open, you may **minimize, resize, or reposition** it freely.  
- **Do not manually interact** with the in-game buttons because this will interfere with the bot.
